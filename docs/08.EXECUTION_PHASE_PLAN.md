Excellent. Below is the **fully revised and strengthened** version of your execution phase plan, aligned with:

* Correct intelligence sequencing
* Research defensibility
* Experimental isolation
* Clean architectural layering
* Clear Git milestone tagging

This replaces your previous version.

---

# 📘 EXECUTION PHASE PLAN — REVISED & RESEARCH-ALIGNED

---

# 🎯 OVERARCHING PRINCIPLE

Each phase must:

* Produce a runnable system
* Introduce only one intelligence layer
* Preserve architectural integrity
* End with a Git tag
* Be experimentally isolatable

No mixing of intelligence layers.

No premature optimization.

---

# 🧱 PHASE 0 — FOUNDATION & INFRASTRUCTURE LOCK-IN

## Objective

Establish a stable, reproducible, layered architecture.

## Includes

* Folder structure
* Docker environment
* SQLite initialization
* Health endpoint
* Streamlit health UI
* Logging
* Basic test setup
* Git initialization + baseline tag

## Must NOT Include

* AST logic
* Graph logic
* Scoring logic

## Exit Criteria

* `docker compose up` works cleanly
* `/health` returns OK
* DB auto-creates and persists
* Tests pass
* Tag created:
  `v0.1-foundation`

---

# 🔄 PHASE 1 — MINIMAL VERTICAL SLICE

## Objective

Prove end-to-end architecture flow with minimal intelligence.

## Pipeline

Upload files → Parse minimally → Build minimal graph → Store run → Return metrics → Display in UI

## Includes

* Basic PHP file ingestion
* Minimal AST extraction (class + method + call detection)
* Directed graph construction (NetworkX)
* Graph JSON serialization
* Persist run metadata (not full graph relationally)
* `/analyze` endpoint
* UI display of:

  * file count
  * class count
  * edge count

## Must NOT Include

* Centrality
* Risk scoring
* DB write detection
* Extraction ranking
* Visualization

## Exit Criteria

* Analysis runs twice without corruption
* Separate JSON per run
* Failures handled gracefully
* Tag created:
  `v0.2-vertical-slice`

---

# 🧠 PHASE 2 — STRUCTURAL GRAPH INTELLIGENCE

## Objective

Validate structural correctness of the system.

This phase introduces measurable structural intelligence.

## Includes

### Graph Metrics

* In-degree
* Out-degree
* Weighted degree
* Betweenness centrality
* Strongly connected components
* Blast radius
* Coupling indicators

### Persistence

* Metric storage in SQLite
* Extend schema to store component metrics

### API

* `/metrics/{run_id}` endpoint

## Must NOT Include

* Risk scoring
* Classification
* DB write detection
* Extraction ranking

## Why Isolation Matters

Structural correctness must be validated before applying scoring assumptions.

This phase allows:

* Metric verification
* Sensitivity checks
* Graph validation

## Exit Criteria

* Metrics stable across repeated runs
* No graph inconsistencies
* Structural metrics persisted
* Tag created:
  `v0.3-structural-metrics`

---

# 📊 PHASE 3 — RISK MODELING LAYER

## Objective

Transform structural metrics into a formal risk model.

This phase introduces weighted scoring.

## Includes

### Risk Model

* Metric normalization
* Weighted aggregation
* Risk score computation ∈ [0,1]
* Percentile classification

### Persistence

* Risk score storage
* Risk level storage

### API

* `/risk/{run_id}` endpoint

### UI

* Risk display table
* Risk ranking list

## Must NOT Include

* DB write detection
* Extraction scoring

## Why Separation Matters

You must be able to compare:

* Raw structural metrics
* Risk-weighted metrics

This supports ablation studies.

## Exit Criteria

* Risk reproducible
* Risk ∈ [0,1]
* Classification stable
* Tag created:
  `v0.4-risk-model`

---

# 🧪 PHASE 4 — BEHAVIORAL INTELLIGENCE (DB WRITE DETECTION)

## Objective

Introduce behavioral context into structural risk.

## Includes

### Static Analysis Enhancements

* SQL write detection (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
* Table name extraction
* Write-frequency attribution
* Table-node creation in graph

### Behavioral Metrics

* Write intensity score
* DB centrality indicator

### Integration

* Risk multiplier adjustment

## Why This Phase Is Separate

Behavioral analysis is a second intelligence dimension.
It must be measured independently before integration.

Allows:

* Structural-only vs structural+behavior comparison

## Exit Criteria

* Writes correctly detected
* False positives minimized
* Risk shifts measurable
* Tag created:
  `v0.5-behavioral-intelligence`

---

# 🏗 PHASE 5 — EXTRACTION INTELLIGENCE & SIMULATION

## Objective

Rank modernization candidates using validated intelligence.

## Includes

### Extraction Model

* Cohesion proxy
* Extraction score formula
* Ranking algorithm
* Core-node protection rule

### Simulation

* Node removal simulation
* Impact estimation

### API

* `/extraction/{run_id}` endpoint

### UI

* Ranked extraction candidates

## Why It Comes Last

Extraction depends on:

* Structural intelligence
* Risk model
* Behavioral context

Without validated upstream layers, ranking is arbitrary.

## Exit Criteria

* Ranked candidates produced
* Stable ordering
* Simulation reproducible
* Tag created:
  `v0.6-modernization-engine`

---

# 📈 PHASE 6 — EVALUATION & SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

## Objective

Validate academic claims.

## Includes

* Precision/Recall
* F1 score
* Weight perturbation experiments
* Ground truth comparison
* Ablation studies

## Deliverable

* Evaluation report
* Charts
* Statistical stability analysis

## Exit Criteria

* Quantified performance metrics
* Sensitivity documented
* Tag created:

---

# ⚡ PHASE 7 — PERFORMANCE & HARDENING

## Objective

Improve efficiency without changing intelligence logic.

## Includes

* Parallel parsing
* Caching
* Memory optimization
* Profiling

## Must NOT Modify

* Risk formulas
* Extraction formulas

## Exit Criteria

* Runtime improvements measurable
* Memory stable
* Tag created:
  `v0.8-performance-stable`

# 🎬 PHASE 8 — DEMO & FINALIZATION

## Objective

## Includes

* Graph visualization
* UI polish
* Export functionality
* Documentation finalization

## Exit Criteria

* Demo-ready system

# 🔬 RESEARCH STRENGTH ADVANTAGE OF THIS STRUCTURE

This phase design allows:

* Clear thesis chapter mapping
* Clean experimental layering
* Isolated intelligence validation
* Ablation study credibility
* Sensitivity analysis clarity

Each intelligence layer is independently testable.

---

# 🔐 STRICT PHASE RULE

You cannot introduce logic from a future phase early.

Violations destroy experimental clarity.

---

# 🧠 FINAL STRATEGIC NOTE

You are not just building software.

You are constructing:

* A layered research artifact
* A defensible experimental framework
* A reproducible modernization intelligence system

Sequence determines strength.

---

If you want next, we can:

* Convert this into a Git milestone + branch strategy map
* Map this to thesis chapter structure
* Design Phase 2 structural metric implementation blueprint
* Or stress-test the risk model design mathematically

Your move.
